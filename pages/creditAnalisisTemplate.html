            <p><strong>What Is A Credit Score?</strong></p>
            <p>
                A credit score is a number generated by a mathematical formula that is meant to predict
                creditworthiness.
                Credit scores range from 300-850. The higher your score is, the more likely you are to get a loan. The
                lower
                your score is, the less likely you are to get a loan. If you have a low credit score and manage to get
                approved
                for credit, your interest rate will be much higher than someone who had a good credit score. So, having
                a high
                credit score will save you many thousands of dollars.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What Is A Credit Bureau?</strong></p>
            <p>
                A credit bureau is a company that collects and maintains your credit information and sells it to
                lenders, creditors
                and consumers in the form of a credit report. There are dozens of credit bureaus, we're most concerned
                with
                the big three: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How Credit Bureaus Determine your Credit Score</strong></p>
            <p>
                <img src="/Credit_Repair/Credit_repair_bot/pages/img-pdf1.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>
                The percentages in this chart show how important each of the categories is in determining your credit
                score.
                We will help you to remove negative items from your payment history. We will also show you how to
                maximize
                your debt ratio score, even if paying off credit cards is not an option.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How Your Behavior Is Evaluated In Your Credit Report:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong>Do you pay your bills on time?</strong> Payment history is a major factor in credit scoring. If
                you have paid bills late,
                have collections or a bankruptcy, these events won't reflect well in your credit score.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Do you have a long credit history?</strong> Generally speaking, the longer your history of
                holding accounts is, the
                more trusted you will be as a borrower.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Have you applied for credit recently?</strong> If you have many recent inquiries this can be
                construed as being
                negative by the bureaus. Only apply for credit when you really want it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What is your outstanding debt?</strong> It is important to not use all of your available credit.
                If all of your credit cards
                are maxed out, your scores will reflect that you are not managing your debt wisely.

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <span><strong>800 and Higher </strong></span>
                <span>(Excellent) With a credit score in this range no
                    lender will ever disapprove your loan
                    application. Additionally, the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) on your credit cards will be the lowest
                    possible.
                    You'll be treated as royalty. Achieving this excellent credit rating not only requires financial
                    knowledge and
                    discipline, but also a good credit history. Generally speaking, to achieve this excellent rating you
                    must also use
                    a substantial amount of credit on an ongoing monthly basis and always repay it ahead of time.</span>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <span><strong>700 - 799 </strong></span>
                <span> (Very Good) 27% of the United States population belongs to this credit score range. With this
                    credit
                    score range, you will enjoy good rates and approved for nearly any type of credit loan or personal
                    loan, whether
                    unsecured or secured.</span>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <span><strong>680 - 699 </strong></span>
                <span> (Good) This range is the average credit score. In this range approvals are practically guaranteed
                    but
                    the interest rates might be marginally higher. If you're thinking about a long term loan such as a
                    mortgage, try
                    working to increase your credit score higher than 720 and you will be rewarded for your efforts;
                    your long term
                    savings will be noticeable.</span>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <span><strong>620 - 679 </strong></span>
                <span> (OK or Fair) Depending on what kind of loan or credit you are applying for and your credit
                    history, you
                    might find that the rates you are quoted aren't best. That doesn't mean that you won't be approved
                    but, certain
                    restrictions will apply to the loan's terms.</span>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <span><strong>580 - 619 </strong></span>
                <span> (Poor) With a poor credit rating you can still get an unsecured personal loan and even a
                    mortgage,
                    but the terms and interest rates won't be very appealing. You'll be required to pay more over a
                    longer period of
                    time because of the high interest rates.</span>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <span><strong>500 - 579 </strong></span>
                <span> (Bad) With a score in this range you can get a loan but nothing even close to what you expect it
                    to be.
                    Some people with bad credit apply for loans to consolidate debt in search for a fresh start.
                    However, if you
                    decide to do that proceed cautiously. With a 500 credit score you need to make sure that you don't
                    default on
                    payments or you'll be making your situation worse and might head towards bankruptcy, which is not
                    what you
                    want.</span>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <span><strong>499 and Lower </strong></span>
                <span> (Very Bad) If this is your score range you need serious assistance with how you handle your
                    credit. You're making too many credit blunders and they will only get worse if you don't take
                    positive action. If
                    you are thinking of a loan (which won't be easy), the rates will be very high and the terms will be
                    very strict. We
                    recommend that you fix your credit first before applying for a loan.</span>

            <p><strong>PART 2 - YOUR CREDIT SCORES AND SUMMARY
                </strong></p>
            <p>We have analyzed your credit reports from the three major bureaus. Here are our findings:

            <p><strong>Your Credit Scores:

            <p style="margin:20px;"><strong>Keep Your Credit Monitoring Account Active Throughout The Credit Repair
                    Process</strong></p>
            <p>Your credit scores may vary depending on where you get your credit reports from, because different
                sources
                have different methods for determining your score and scheduling updates. Maintaining one (1) credit
                monitoring account will give us a baseline score as a point of reference to grow from, to accurately see
                changes
                as they happen. For this reason, you must keep your same credit monitoring account active, rather than
                checking your scores on multiple sites that will differ.</p>

            <p>Next we analyzed all the items on your reports, to determine which accounts are negatively impacting your
                score. Here are our findings:</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Your Derogatory Items:
                </strong></p>
            <p>You have <span><strong>9</strong></span> items marked as delinquent or derogatory. Recent late payments,
                collections, and other derogatory
                items within the last six months will hurt your credit score more than older inactive accounts. Accounts
                within
                the last 24 months carry the second most weight. This is why it is crucial to pay all bills on time and
                do not miss
                any payments.</p>
